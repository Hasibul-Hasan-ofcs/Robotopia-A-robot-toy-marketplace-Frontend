    text: "React has come a long way in the past decade, undergoing significant transformations that have made it one of the most widely used front-end UI frameworks available today. Initially, Reactâ€™s verbose syntax made it challenging for developers to work with. However, React introduced the JSX syntax, simplifying the creation of components. To follow, functional components with Hooks made it easier to handle state and life-cycle functions, leading to more elegant, readable, and maintainable code. With the introduction of server-side rendering (SSR) in React 16, performance improved by allowing faster initial page load times and better search engine optimization (SEO). And full-stack frameworks like Next.js and Remix have made React even more accessible, further increasing its popularity.",
